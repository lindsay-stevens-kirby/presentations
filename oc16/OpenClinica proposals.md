# OpenClinica centred environment at KI
In the KI VHCRP, OpenClinica is central to data management. This session discusses the DM processes directly utilising OC, as well as external utilities and data sources that interact with OC, including:

- Community Datamart,
- Datamart-based study management tools,
- Open Data Kit (ODK) Collect on Android tablets,
- Med-ic Electronic blister packs,
- LabKey test results and archival sample metadata storage,
- MedDRA coding of adverse event terms,
- LimeSurvey online surveys.

Also touching on practical DM issues such as:
- Data handling life cycle (collection, cleaning, storage, governance, privacy / PHI),
- Study design life cycle (specification, build, go live, maintenance, updates).

# Tablet Data Collection with ODK Collect
Following a successful pilot project, the KI VHCRP has been rolling out a tablet based data collection system. This system uses Android tablets, the ODK Collect app, XForms and XLSForm to deliver a high quality, secure and primarily offline electronic data capture process for patient reported outcomes. This session will cover practical aspects of the system including:

- A brief overview of the XForms universe,
- Android deployment environment (including Google Apps for Education),
- Data flow from participant to OpenClinica,
- Study development process and tools for XForms,
- Challenges and future plans for online data submission.

# OpenClinica deployment (on Windows)
Many of the questions posted to the OpenClinica forums relate to setting up an instance of OpenClinica, either as a local sandbox or a multi-user environment. The OC development team maintain good documentation on the process; this session will demonstrate and expand on this with:

- Step by step demonstration of installation,
- Start-up, restart and maintenance,
- Installation validation,
- Version upgrade procedure,
- Setting up backups,
- Advanced configuration for increased security.

# Community Datamart
Following the OC15 presentation, this session will provide an overview / re-cap and update on the community datamart project. Frequently asked questions will (hopefully) be addressed by a step by step demonstration of the "basic" setup procedure, discussion of the advanced setup, and discussion of study design parameters that affect the datamart build process.
